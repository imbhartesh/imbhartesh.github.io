It was nice actually for the first time we gathered in Senate Hall of SASTRA for the Best Student Project Award. 

Dr K.Kesavasamy Global Head of TCS, Trivandrum who was the chief guest along with our dean Mr. Swaminathan made the ceremony more useful by delivering the importance of project during the curriculum and its door opened opportunity in Industries.. 

Worth saying will always be worth to listen :)
