It has been a long time since my last post. I was bit busy with my academic work, i have had one of those moments when my own sinfulness reared its ugly head. My goodthing is always i ll back to my track. April is one of my fav role in ["Definately may be"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832266/) and i love Maya more… Middle of this april went on preparing and writting III – CIA.

I discussed a lot about the project work with my colleague Nanthu and Madhumitha. We need to come out of some messy kinda situation right there in our college. We just have a RasperryPi Kit to play around. "One for Three" will demolished the ideas and we decided to buy and start doing things using Arduino – Open Source Hardware.

Exactly on 20th, we purchased handy Arduino Uno Development Board again the problem is its not a genuine board its Clone.. I hate that word now "Clone..Cl..o.'ne'..The UNO is based on ATmega328 microcontroller with a range of analog and digital I/O pins for controlling and sensing their environment. Arduino IDE is used to programme which is available for boyh Windows and Linux.

Earlier my system was configured to dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04, during first week i got release of Windows 8 and i installed over windows 7. Then as usual i conquered by the problem computer just boots directly to Windows 8. I guessed the problem with Grub. Then i googled i got handy information regarding Boot – Repair here. It fixed my problem smoothly. I enjoyed the UI & Apps of windows 8.
