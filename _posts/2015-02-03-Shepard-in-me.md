Last year I planned to read more books. I ended up with the most inspired “The Alchemist”. Once i started i was not sure that i would finish reading. Because i never came to last page of any book which i started.

This book was different, mean bit confusing and slow at first. Few pages really admired me. One day, the final day came and i was in hurry to finish the last few pages in wish to start the new book. Then i read this line…

> You’re not going to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be so stupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the 	roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.
	
I was stunned because i really felt that particular moment of my life was as same as that Shepard boy’s life. Life is not about its destination its all about the journey. Happiness is not made in heaven its now here at your foot.

## Few Other Lines…

We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our possessions or our property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand

…whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.
