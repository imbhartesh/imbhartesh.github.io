I am a Software Engineer working in BI based projects. I live in Chennai, INDIA and work for Tata Consultancy Services as System Engineer.

I always wanted to be a computer freak, and that journey strated from 2011. Post graduation in Embedded system and graduation in Electronics & Communication made me enough to deal with this Sci-Fi society.

Learning. Loving. Dreaming. Hoping. Praying.
