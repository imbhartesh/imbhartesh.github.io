I am a Software Engineer who loves to explore and analyse the data. I live in Chennai, INDIA and currenlty working in Tata Consultancy Services as IT Analyst.

I always wanted to be a computer freak, and that journey strated from 2011. Post graduation in Embedded system and graduation in Electronics & Communication made me enough to deal with this Sci-Fi society.

Learning. Loving. Dreaming. Hoping. Praying.
